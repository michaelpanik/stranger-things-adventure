# Stranger Things 2 Adventure Game
A Stranger Things-inspired, Apple II style text adventure game, browser based and built with vanilla JS.

The goal is to create a game based on Stranger Things 2 that is also period-specific to the year the series takes place, 1984. At this time, the Apple II was probably the most popular personal computer, so I wanted to make a game akin to The Oregon Trail and other, similar adventure games.

It may suck, I dunno. It's a one-week-while-the-girlfriend-is-out-of-town type project. Just play and enjoy(?).

## Objectives
The Demadogs have surfaced through the Gate and run amok in Hawkins National Laboratory, including turning off the power, and activating the building's emergency lock down. You play as Bob Newby, leaving the sanctuary of the surveillance room to find your way to the power room, inputting the power code, getting to the exit, and hopefully avoiding the Demadogs. Luckily, the others back in the surveillance room can monitor the building and tell you when the Demadogs are around the corner. Nothing to worry about - right?

## Gameplay
Use arrow keys to choose from your options, and enter to select one.

## Hints
1. Take notes on paper.
2. You may consider making a map.
3. Concrete floors can be a real...pain.
4. You are scared of the dark, but they aren't.
